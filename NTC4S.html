						<p>This week on the Not Too Cool 4 School podcast, I had the privilege of interviewing one of the best upcoming 
						children's authors and business communication experts, <a href="https://megan.preston-meyer.com/">Megan Preston Meyer</a>. Megan is the Author of 
						<a href="https://www.supply-jane.com/">The Supply Jane and Fifo Adventures</a> book series which focuses on teaching kids critical thinking skills, 
						system processes, creativity, and allowing parents to have an interactive adventure with their kids while 
						preparing the future generation for careers in supply chain and manufacturing. She also coaches businesses 
						with their professional communication, helping them find their tone, remove unnecessary jargon, and improve 
						authenticity which helps improve client relationships, conversions, and creates long-term benefits. We also 
						discuss the importance of finding joy in all the little things that make us happy and that we don't need to 
						have huge or creative hobbies to be happy. This episode is not only fun but really insightful about being an 
						author, communication, and more that you won't want to miss! </p>

						Victoria and I discuss her upbringing and her parent's path to citizenship (a huge accomplishment!), her desire 
						to start a family and battle with PCOS, how the little things like gardening create a clear head, testing the 
						waters of anime, and her unwavering faith that no matter what difficulty you are facing everything will be okay. 
						Not only is this episode encouraging and uplifting, but Victoria is fun and hilarious the entire time and I 
						had an amazing time talking to her. This is one you won't want to miss!</p>
