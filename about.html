						<p>Growing up, I was raised by a sales family, my parents owned a car business in 
						California and my father would always teach me the art of sales, people, and business. As I grew 
						up, I learned from leading professionals the art of business in many different sectors. Having 
						a problem with employee communication and productivity? Let's fix that. Is your marketing plan not
						working? Let's identify the problem (and not waste your money while we do it). Is your company not 
						getting the PR it needs, don't worry, I've gotten media for multiple individuals and their brand and 
						company on major publication.<br><br>
						
						Essentially it comes down to this, you can work with a PR or marketing firm and spend thousands 
						of dollars just to be told "we don't guarantee it will work" or you can work with me and I will work until
						we get the results you want in whatever area you need (without changing the original price or agreement)! I
						will work and use all of my knowledge, every technique, and tool that I have to make sure you are successful. 
						As an Eagle Scout, you have my word!<br><br>
						
						Who am I when I'm not working? I'm a husband and father as well as foodie. I love exploring new areas, trying 
						new things (except at the drive-thru), I'm a wrestler and enjoy working out. However, I also love to give back to 
						the community and help them come together, so I started a nonprofit (501(c)3 approved) called Unity Community 
						Initiative.
